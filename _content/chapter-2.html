      <p>Even if patients enroll in their patient portal, many don&rsquo;t use it.  These patients may not know the benefits: Portals can help them better manage their care. Portals give patients a convenient, secure platform for seeing valuable medical information, communicating with providers, and handling administrative tasks (like booking appointments).</p>

      <p>But getting the most out of these features requires engagement from providers, too. In some cases, providers are reluctant to take advantage of these capabilities. Many worry that more patient engagement will create more work for their practice.</p>

      <p>The reality is that patient engagement offers a clear payoff for providers: Patients who use a portal are nearly 2.6 times more likely to stay patients than those who don&rsquo;t.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> And, by giving patients greater access to information online, providers and practices are in a better position to achieve Meaningful Use objectives. For example, Meaningful Use sets a goal for providers and practices to enable patients to <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/achieve-meaningful-use/core-measures-2/patient-ability-electronically-view-download-transmit-vdt-health-information">view online, download, and transmit their health information within 4 business days of the information being available to the EP [eligible professional]</a>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

      <p>Ensuring that patients get the most out of the portal can add up to big benefits. For patients with chronic diseases, engagement in patient portals has been associated with improvements in disease management.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Portals can also improve preventive care. Patients with portal access to screening recommendations &mdash; like when to get their next mammogram or colonoscopy &mdash; are more likely to follow through on these recommendations.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

      <p>For providers and patients to reap these benefits, they must overcome the pain points and understand the realities of patient engagement. In this chapter, we&rsquo;ll debunk patient portal myths and describe portal solutions with proven value.</p>

      <p>Graphic: Checklist of solutions (features to activate in the portal)</p>

      <p>Use these features to engage your patients in their care and make care coordination and communication more convenient, efficient, and effective &mdash; for them and for you.</p>


      <h2>Allow online booking and prescription refills</h2>

      <p>Booking medical appointments and refilling prescriptions over the phone can be time-consuming for both patients and providers. On average, it takes a little more than 8 minutes to make an appointment over the phone.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

      <p>Use the portal to enable patients to book medical appointments and refill prescriptions online &mdash; and free up staff to support your practice in more valuable ways.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

        <p><strong>From the field: Kaiser Permanente</strong></p>
        <p>As of 2014, about half of Kaiser Permanente&rsquo;s nearly 10 million members were using Kaiser&rsquo;s online health management platform. In 2014, Kaiser members made more than 4 million online appointment requests and refilled more than 17 million online prescriptions.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

        <p>Kaiser tells patients upfront when they can expect to get an appointment if they book online.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

        <p>Through the portal, Kaiser also gives patients clear instructions for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Filling a prescription for the first time</li>
          <li>Refilling prescriptions online</li>
          <li>Transferring prescriptions from another health system</li>
          <li>Checking which medications are covered by their plan</li>
          <li>Reading up on medication instructions and side effects<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>

      <h2>Set up secure information sharing</h2>

      <p>There are many scenarios in which patients and providers need to communicate in between visits. Patients may have follow-up questions about a provider&rsquo;s guidance or a medication. Providers may need to share test results or explain a recommendation in more detail.</p>

      <p>Patient portals offer an opportunity to improve and streamline patient-provider communication. The portal&rsquo;s secure email can reduce the need for face-to-face visits and phone calls by giving patients and providers a quick, convenient way to exchange information.</p>
      <p>Using the portal, patients and providers can:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Share brief messages and updates</li>
      <li>Clarify issues and advice</li>
      <li>Correct misunderstandings before they become significant problems</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Providers can also use the portal to share lab results &mdash; a best practice identified by some EHRs, like athenahealth &mdash; or other post-visit follow-up with patients.</p>

      <p>To maximize efficiency, practices must integrate reading and responding to email into their workflow. For example, they can assign a staff member to acknowledge all patient messages within 1 business day. Providers can then respond to the patient&rsquo;s question or issue at their convenience.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

        <p><strong>From the field: Kaiser Permanente</strong></p>
        <p>Lab test results and secure patient-provider email became widely available to Kaiser Permanente members in 2006. Over the next year, the numbers of lab results viewed online and email messages sent to providers grew steadily. Between 2006 and 2007, lab test results viewed online increased 157 percent and email messages to providers increased 152 percent. Viewing test results soon became the most-used portal feature.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>

        <p>Kaiser members primarily emailed their providers to discuss:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A change in health condition</li>
        <li>Lab results</li>
        <li>New condition</li>
        <li>Prescription dose</li>
        <li>The need for a new prescription</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These emails can prompt necessary care that may have otherwise been overlooked. 6 out of 10 patient-initiated emails led to new clinical assessments or decisions, and 1 in 4 required clinical action (like a lab test).<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

        <p><strong>From the field: Primary Health Medical Group case study</strong><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
        <p>Primary Health Medical Group providers can send lab results to patients using secure messaging. Providers can include a brief message explaining the results (for example, &ldquo;Your results are normal&rdquo;) and any needed follow‐up instructions (for example, &ldquo;Come back in 3 months for a recheck&rdquo;). For serious lab results, providers use the phone to discuss results with the patient. Providers encourage patients to review their medical information and report inaccuracies.</p>

      <h2>Share notes</h2>

      <p>Provider notes can give patients a snapshot of a visit so they can better understand and act on their provider&rsquo;s advice after the visit has ended. Patients have always had a right to see these notes &mdash; but until recently there hasn&rsquo;t been a simple, straight-forward way to access them.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

      <p>By offering patients access to notes through a portal, providers can promote transparency and change the way people engage with their health and care.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

        <p>A study across these 3 sites found that most providers had positive or neutral experiences with OpenNotes (a national initiative that promotes sharing notes with patients<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>). When asked about the most difficult aspect of open notes, 3 out of 4 providers commented that nothing was difficult and that they experienced no changes in their practice. Several doctors acknowledged fears about an additional time burden and offending or worrying patients &mdash; but said that these concerns didn&rsquo;t materialize.</p>

        <p>The majority of patients who participated in the study used OpenNotes. Out of roughly 13,500 patients with access to provider notes, more than 11,000 had opened at least 1 note.</p>

        <p>Patients across all health systems reported experiencing benefits from seeing notes. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>77% to 87% across the 3 sites reported that open notes helped them feel more in control of their care.</li>
        <li>60% to 78% of those taking medications reported increased medication adherence.</li>
        <li>20% to 42% reported sharing notes with others.</li>

      <p><strong>Tips for Providers</strong></p>
      <p>When sharing notes with patients, it&rsquo;s important to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Explain to patients what they can expect to see in the notes</li>
      <li>Use plain language instead of medical jargon or abbreviations</li>
      <li>Soften language, when necessary (for example, instead of calling a patient &ldquo;non-compliant,&rdquo; write the &ldquo;patient chose not to...&rdquo;)</li>
      <li>Keep notes focused on specific issues</li>
      <li>Discuss lab or study results, if applicable</li>
      <li>Reference educational materials, whenever possible<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>

        <p><strong>From the field:</strong> <strong>Kaiser Permanente<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><strong><sup>19</sup></strong></a></strong></p>
        <p>Kaiser has found that most patients with access to visit notes read them, and many discuss them with providers or loved ones. The majority of Kaiser patients who used OpenNotes reported improved self-care:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>70&ndash;72% of patients reported taking better care of themselves.</li>
        <li>77&ndash;85% reported better understanding of their health and medical conditions.</li>
        <li>76&ndash;84% reported remembering to plan for their care better.</li>
        <li>69&ndash;80% felt better prepared for visits.</li>
        <li>77&ndash;87% felt more in control of their care.</li>
        <li>60&ndash;78% of patients taking medications reported improvements in taking medications as prescribed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This increased patient involvement in health and medical care can lead to more efficient care, better patient-provider communication and, ultimately, healthier outcomes.</p>

        <p>Access to OpenNotes is important to the majority of Kaiser members: Roughly 6 out of 10 members who logged onto KP.org after a recent visit said that OpenNotes would be a &ldquo;very important&rdquo; factor in future health plan decisions. About 4 out of 10 who hadn&rsquo;t logged on said the same.</p>
