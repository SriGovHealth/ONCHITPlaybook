      <p>Patient portals have the potential to streamline provider workflow and improve patient engagement.</p>

      <p>But at first, providers may be overwhelmed by the number of features that portals offer or fear that using the portal will be cumbersome and ineffective.</p>

      <p>You can take small steps to overcome these barriers and get the most out of your patient portal. Although patient portals vary from vendor to vendor, most include a basic set of features that offer value to patients. These features can improve the way providers and patients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Handle administrative tasks, like booking appointments</li>
        <li>Communicate with each other</li>
        <li>Manage care</li>

          <p>As of 2014, about half of Kaiser Permanente&rsquo;s nearly 10 million members were using Kaiser&rsquo;s online health management platform. In 2014, Kaiser members made more than 4 million online appointment requests and refilled more than 17 million online prescriptions.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-14' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref14">14</a></sup></p>

          <p>Through the portal, Kaiser also gives patients clear instructions for:</p>

          <li>Filling a prescription for the first time</li>
          <li>Refilling prescriptions online</li>

      <p>There are many scenarios in which patients and providers need to communicate in between visits. Patients may have follow-up questions about a provider&rsquo;s guidance or a medication<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-17' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref17">17</a></sup>. Providers may need to share test results or explain a recommendation in more detail.</p>

      <p>Patient portals offer an opportunity to improve and streamline patient-provider communication. The portal&rsquo;s secure email can reduce the need for face-to-face visits and phone calls by giving patients and providers a quick, convenient way to exchange information.</p>

      <ul>

      <li>Clarify issues and advice</li>
      <li>Correct misunderstandings before they become significant problems</li>

      </ul>

      <p>You can also use the portal to share lab results &mdash; a best practice identified by some EHRs, like athenahealth &mdash; or other post-visit follow-up with patients.</p>

      <p>To maximize efficiency, practices must integrate reading and responding to email into their workflow. For example, assign a staff member to acknowledge all patient messages within 1 business day. Providers can then respond to the patient&rsquo;s question or issue at their convenience.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-19' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref19">19</a></sup></p>

      <h3>Tips for Providers</h3>
      <p>Follow these guidelines for communicating with patients by email.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-20' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref20">20</a></sup></p>

      <p><strong>Establish policies for your practice</strong></p>
      <p>Develop policies that address:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Turnaround time for responding to patient emails. Don&rsquo;t use email for urgent issues.</li>
      <li>The types of communication allowed over email. Decide which requests (like prescription refills and appointment scheduling) you&rsquo;ll fulfill and which sensitive topics (like HIV and mental health) you&rsquo;ll discuss.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Address privacy issues</strong></p>
      <ul>
      <li>Let patients know which other providers or practice staff may read and respond to their emails &mdash; for example, outside usual business hours or when you&rsquo;re on vacation. Include this privacy disclaimer in each patient&rsquo;s medical record.</li>
      <li>Keep a mailing list of patients, but only send group emails using the blind copy feature. Never send group emails where patients can see each other&rsquo;s names.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Give patients clear guidance</strong></p>
      <p>Ask patients to:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Write a subject line that describes the nature of their email, like &ldquo;Billing question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Medical advice.&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Call 911 or your office about urgent issues.</li>

          <p>Lab test results and secure patient-provider email became widely available to Kaiser Permanente members in 2006. Over the next year, the numbers of lab results viewed online and email messages sent to providers grew steadily. Between 2006 and 2007, lab test results viewed online increased 157 percent and email messages to providers increased 152 percent. Viewing test results soon became the most-used portal feature.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-21' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref21">21</a></sup></p>

          <div class="callout-mild callout-right">

              <li>Exchange 20 million secure emails</li>
            </ul>

          <p>A study across these 3 sites &mdash; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Massachusetts, Geisinger Health System (GHS) in Pennsylvania, and Harborview Medical Center (HMC) in Washington &mdash; found that most providers had positive or neutral experiences with OpenNotes (a national initiative that promotes sharing notes with patients<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-29' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref29">29</a></sup>). When asked about the most difficult aspect of open notes, 3 out of 4 providers commented that nothing was difficult and that they experienced no changes in their practice. Several doctors acknowledged fears about an additional time burden and offending or worrying patients &mdash; but said that these concerns didn&rsquo;t materialize.</p>

          <p>The majority of patients who participated in the study used OpenNotes. Out of roughly 13,500 patients with access to provider notes, more than 11,000 had opened at least 1 note.</p>
