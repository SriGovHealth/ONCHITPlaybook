      <p>Across the nation, patients’ phones and computers are teeming with patient-generated health data: health-related data that patients create, record, or gather to help address a health concern. They include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health history</li>
        <li>Treatment history</li>
        <li>Biometric data, like blood pressure readings</li>

      <p>As the amount of available data has grown, so too has our ability to collect, organize, and make sense of it all. More and more health systems are aggregating patient-generated health data in their EHRs and relying on these data to conduct remote monitoring &mdash; that is, to track patients’ wellness outside the clinic.</p>

      <p>Specifically, patient-generated health data can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show how a patient is doing between visits</li>
        <li>Illustrate a patient’s health and behavior over time</li>
        <li>Inform strategies for preventive care and chronic disease management</li>
        <li>Improve patient safety by providing insight into medication adherence and allergies<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-44' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref44" aria-label="Footnote 44">44</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Providers can take advantage of these data to fill in information gaps &mdash; and, ultimately, improve clinical decision-making and care delivery.</p>

      <p>Portals can streamline data collection by giving patients a platform for securely sharing information and completing online questionnaires. Providers can use the portal to send patients reminders to submit data and to follow up with patients as needed.</p>

      <p>Consider taking steps to integrate patient-generated health data into your practice:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Talk to staff about how patient-generated health data can improve care and efficiency</li>
        <li>Assess what data you’re already gathering and what additional data would be valuable</li>
        <li>Develop policies and procedures, like when to accept data and who will review them</li>
        <li>Educate patients and families about the value of and expectations for sharing patient-generated health data</li>
        <li>Start small &mdash; for example, by launching a pilot to collect symptoms for patients managing a chronic disease &mdash; and make changes as needed<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-45' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref45" aria-label="Footnote 45">45</a></sup></li>

          <p>Ochsner Health System (OHS) is advancing the use of patient-generated health data through partnerships with Apple and its EHR developer.</p>

          <p>Since October 2014, OHS has leveraged Apple HealthKit to create a more comprehensive picture of ongoing patient health. HealthKit, an iOS app, acts as a health dashboard by capturing health and activity data from other apps and wearable devices, like FitBit and Withings wireless blood pressure monitor.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-47' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref47" aria-label="Footnote 47">47</a>,<a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-48' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref48" aria-label="Footnote 48">48</a></sup> Healthkit also has an open API (application programming interface), which enables other web applications to access its data. Using the API, OHS connected HealthKit to its EHR. As a result, OHS patients can automatically import HealthKit data into their EHRs and share it with providers.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-49' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref49" aria-label="Footnote 49">49</a></sup></p>

          <p>OHS piloted this integration in its Digital Medicine Program. The Digital Medicine Program, which focuses on patients with hypertension, uses remote monitoring to collect data including body weights and blood pressure measurements &mdash; all without patients leaving their homes. Providers and pharmacists see the data and follow up with patients in real time by, for example, adjusting their medications or tailoring lifestyle recommendations.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-50' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref50" aria-label="Footnote 50">50</a></sup> One year in, OHS patients reported improved outcomes, engagement, and satisfaction with their care.</p>

          <p>Among patients with uncontrolled blood pressure, 2 out of 3 had their blood pressure in control within 90 days of enrolling in the program.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-51' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref51" aria-label="Footnote 51">51</a></sup> For patients, lower blood pressure means a lower likelihood of heart attack, stroke, and kidney failure &mdash; and greater peace of mind.</p>

          <p>The Center for Connected Health (CCH) implements programs rooted in connected health, a care model that uses information and communications technology &mdash; like mobile phones, computers, and wearable devices &mdash; to support patients&rsquo; health without disrupting their day-to-day lives.</p>

          </div>

          <p>CCH&rsquo;s Connected Cardiac Care Program (CCCP) showcases this approach. CCCP aims to improve self-management in heart failure patients at risk for hospitalization by combining:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Regular clinical care</li>
          <li>Patient education</li>
          <li>Remote monitoring of indicators like blood pressure, heart rate, and weight</li>
          <li>Timely care and clinical feedback<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-56' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref56" aria-label="Footnote 56">56</a></sup></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Providers used a central database to track all patient data. Data were also captured in patients&rsquo; EHRs.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-57' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref57" aria-label="Footnote 57">57</a></sup></p>

          <p>CCH conducted a retrospective study that evaluated the 4-month program<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-58' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref58" aria-label="Footnote 58">58</a></sup>. At the outset, patients in the intervention and control groups had similar hospitalization rates. But for the duration of the program and up to 3 months after, hospitalization dropped significantly for patients enrolled in CCCP compared to those receiving typical care. CCCP patients also experienced significantly lower mortality rates during the program and for up to 4 months after discharge.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-59' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref59" aria-label="Footnote 59">59</a>,<a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-60' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref60" aria-label="Footnote 60">60</a></sup></p>


          <p>In addition to clinical outcomes, CCCP improved patients&rsquo; understanding of heart failure and self-management skills.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-61' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref61" aria-label="Footnote 61">61</a></sup> These skills suggest a long-term payoff &mdash; even if patients have limited time in the program, they can still expect benefits down the line.</p>

          <p>Providers come out on top, too. Even though CCCP costs $1,500 per patient, providers ultimately save $8,155 per patient from reductions in hospitalizations.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-62' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref62" aria-label="Footnote 62">62</a></sup></p>

          <p>&ldquo;My goal over the past year has been to have the family history for most of my patients completed at least involving all first degree relatives.

      <p>Family health history can help predict a patient&rsquo;s disease risk &mdash; essentially, it&rsquo;s the simplest and least expensive form of genetic assessment.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-63' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref63" aria-label="Footnote 63">63</a></sup> Traditionally, collecting and analyzing this information hasn&rsquo;t been a routine part of primary care because of challenges like patients&rsquo; lack of knowledge about family history and providers&rsquo; limited time.</p>

      <p>Now, technology-driven tools are changing the standard of risk assessments. These tools enable patients to systematically collect family health histories and report back to their providers. Providers can then ensure high-risk patients get necessary screenings and specialist care.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-64' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref64" aria-label="Footnote 64">64</a></sup></p>

      <p>Consider taking these steps:</p>
