      <p>Providers often struggle to navigate federal and state laws related to proxy access (allowing someone other than the patient to see a patient&rsquo;s health information). Laws like the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are designed to keep patients&rsquo; medical records and personal health information private and secure &mdash; but there are many situations in which a family member or other caregiver may need this information.</p>

      <p>Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A parent of a child or adolescent</li>
      <li>An adult child or caregiver of an elderly parent</li>
      <li>A home health aide to a chronically ill patient</li>
      <li>A health care power of attorney responsible for an incapacitated patient&rsquo;s medical decisions and care</li>
      <li>Someone else the patient wants involved, like a spouse<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-32' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref32">32</a></sup></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many patient portals still offer a one-size-fits-all approach to information access &mdash; anyone with the right login can see the full medical record. This model ignores the reality for many patients: They have a right to privacy and also need an informed representative to help manage their care.</p>

      <p>For adolescent patients (ages 12 to 17), this can be particularly tricky. Adolescents may want to keep their health care decisions and medical information private. Some laws allow minors to receive specific kinds of health care, like mental or sexual health services, without their parents knowing or consenting. Others say that minors can make decisions on their own if they have an &ldquo;adult status,&rdquo; like being married or in the military. The age when a person is considered an adult and able to make their own health care decisions varies from state to state.<sup><a href="{{ '/references/#footnote-33' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" id="footnote-ref33">33</a></sup></p>

      <p>Parents may also want to keep certain information, like a family history of disease, between only themselves and their adolescent&rsquo;s provider.</p>

      <p>To maximize patient engagement, consider allowing varying levels of access to electronic medical records.</p>

          <p>Boston Children&rsquo;s Hospital (BCH) advocates for patient portals with flexible access that providers can tailor to meet patients&rsquo; and parents&rsquo; needs and to comply with relevant federal and state law.</p>

          <p>Specifically, BCH recommends a portal that gives adolescents and parents access to different types of information. Following this model:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Adolescents can see nearly all of their medical information, including anything sensitive &mdash; like a birth control pill prescription or a Chlamydia test. They can&rsquo;t see any information that their parents have asked to keep private.</li>
          <li>Parents can see information they&rsquo;ve shared with their adolescent&rsquo;s provider and general information about their adolescent&rsquo;s health.</li>
          </ul>

          </div>

          <p>The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has hacked MyChart &mdash; the patient portal offered through their EHR vendor, Epic &mdash; to offer appropriate patient and proxy access that meets MU requirements. The result is Adolescent MyChart.</p>

          <p>Adolescent MyChart gives each audience access to distinct portal information.</p>

          <p><img src="{{ "/img/figure-3-1.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt=""></p>

          <p>At UCSF, parents have limited portal access to potentially sensitive information about their teen children. This lines up with California law, which allows teens between 12 and 17 years old to keep care for medical needs like sexually transmitted disease testing, contraception, and pregnancy care private. For example, parents can&rsquo;t access lab results from a pregnancy test or OB ultrasound.</p>

          <p>Through Adolescent MyChart, UCSF can more successfully engage teens in their care while also protecting their privacy.</p>
